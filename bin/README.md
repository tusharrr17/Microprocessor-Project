# MIPS-pipeline-processor

Thanks for visiting this repository!

Developed during the Fall 2017 Computer Architecture Laboratory course at the University of Tehran, 
this project is an implementation of a pipelined MIPS processor featuring hazard detection as well as forwarding.
This implementation is based on a limited ISA, the details for which are present in `docs/MIPS_ISA.png`.
This code is synthesizable and can be run on an FPGA. We used Altera DE2 units for testing purposes. The implemtation has been verified using a relatively complex test program (found in `instructions/example_source_code.txt`).

## Getting Started

Download or clone the project, write your machine code to run (there already exists a default test program in the instruction memory),
compile the Verilog files and and run testbench.v in a Verilog simulation environment such as ModelSim from Mentor Graphics.

### Instruction format

Instructions should be provided to the instruction memory in reset time. We avoided the `readmemb` and `readmemh` functions to 
keep the code synthesizable. The instruction memory cells are 8 bits long, whereas each instruction is 32 bits long. 
Therefore, each instruction takes up four memory cells, as shown bellow.

For example, an add instruction: `10000000001000000000000000001010` or `Addi r1,r0,10` will need to be given as 

```
instMem[0] <= 8'b10000000;
instMem[1] <= 8'b00100000;
instMem[2] <= 8'b00000000;
instMem[3] <= 8'b00001010;
```

### Converting your raw machine codes

A python script is provided under the `instructions/rearrange_instructions.py` directory which simply takes your 
machine code (in a specified format) and converts it to the format illustrated above.

### Enable/disable forwarding

An instance of the top-level circuit is taken in `testbench.v`. 
The inputs of the `MIPS_Processor` include `clk`, `rst`, and `forwarding_EN`.
Forwarding will be enabled if `forwarding_EN` is set to 1, and disabled otherwise.

## Under the hood

There are five pipeline stages: 

1. Instruction Fetch
2. Instruction Decode
3. Execution
4. Memory
5. Write Back

### Modular design

All modules are organized under the `modules` directory.
The top level description can be found under `topLevelCircuit.v`. It contains a **modular design** of the processor and 
encompasses five pipe stages and four pipe registers, the description for which are present under `modules/pipeStages` and 
`modules/pipeRegisters` respectively. The register file, the hazard detection and the forwarding units are also instantiated
in `topLevelCircuit.v`. Pipe stages are made of and encapsulate other supporting modules.

### Constants

`defines.v` contains project-wide constants for **opcodes**, **execution commands**, and **branch condition commands**. 
It also contains constants for wire widths and memory specifications. You can change memory size values to suit your needs.

### Wire naming convention

To maintain conformity, most wire names follow the format {wire description}_{wire stage}, where the second part describes 
the stage where the wire is located. For example, `MEM_W_EN_ID` is the memory write enable signal present in the instruction decode stage.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcomed, both general improvements as well as new features such as a more realistic memory heirarchy or branch prediction. However, please follow the coding styles and the naming convention. Another useful contribution would be more comprehensive testing and verification and bug report.
